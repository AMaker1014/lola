Calm down, haste makes waste, y’know, Copen? Not like I'm also NOT annoyed about this, though... 
Copen! I’m warmed up and ready to go! Isn’t it about time for me to shine? 
Roger that! Battle Pod “Lola”, deploying! Niiiice! I finally get to shine! Oh yeah! By the way, Acura-kun, are you keeping an eye on how many “Blitz” you have left? You lose Blitz when you use Blitz dash or "E.M Boundary". They automatically refill when you're grounded, but you can manually reload, see? You can also reload in mid-air, but it'll make you land, so watch your step. 
Ewww, who was that? A pervert? 
Huh? Whoa, true. Creepy... 
Go go~! Smash 'em up! Copen! 
"A little much"... you're the one who programmed ME, the AI, aren't you?! 
Looks like it’ll be easier to lock into that enemy by using a Blitz dash! 
You can do a diagonal Blitz dash if you look up while dashing. Use the all-bounding to move on ahead, Acura-kun! 
Your Flashfield can't protect you from that gatling! 
Remember: you won't be able to use it if your Weapon Gauge is not full, when you use an EX Weapon like Stellar Spark. 
On the flipside, if you wanna take it down fast, aim for its upper body. 

Controlling hair, huh...Doesn’t sound too impressive...Ack! Hair! Control over hair...Might be amazing, actually... 
Copen, you need a diet! A diet! 
Try to advance while locking into the hovering foes, then! If you can pull it off you could climb upwards, too... 
Huh? You’ve been here before? I didn’t know that. 
There’s a robot I hadn’t seen before. 
Ride into the tailwind and use the Dash Jump! 
Copen, you said it’s your second time coming here but...Hey, what did it feel like? Was outer space cool? 
What’s with that cold reply? 
Roger. If we take too long Nori will start to worry. 

Hm...OK! “EX Weapon System”: all green! No hitches! You can use it anytime. My idea of compensating the lacking output with my AB Drive worked out but when you use an EX Weapon and the Weapon Gauge decreases...you can’t use the “Flash Field”- the barrier. So don’t forget that, OK? Same applies when using “Spark Stellar” so it’ll be a similar feeling the Weapon Gauge fills up automatically. And unlike the “Blitz”, I can’t reload it if I use an “EX Weapon” I’ll can’t shield missiles or other weapons. 
You LOVE that kind of wording. Typical of you, Copen. 

Well, I *am* pretty great... 
Maybe you need a nap, boss. 
But if you get killed because you're tired? What then, huh? Look, I get you're worried about Mytyl. It's cute. Nice, even. But if you let it consume you, it ends up hurting everyone. Now get some damn rest so you're ready for the next mission! 
Now if only you'd be that sensible more often. 
Heh heh. 
He's lying, Mytyl. 
Aw yeah, girl! Put it on me right now! 
This is starting to get a bit weird, Copen. 
Oh yeah! That's the stuff! Right there! Mmmrrrgghhh... 
Mytyl! Girl! I haven't seen you in forevs! 
Ha! As if you could build someone as witty as me! 
You two are both starting to scare me. 
We're still on for today, right, girl? 
Mytyl's gonna help me create a new outfit! 
You don't understand anything, Copen! Style is important no matter *what* you're doing! Right, Mytyl? 
Whoa, hold on! That's delicate machinery! 
Yeah, man! Who sits around pounding on machines? Not cool! 
I am? ...Oh! I am! The ol' red badge of courage, I guess. 
Aw, thanks girl! I don't know what to say... 

This place is real run down. We sure they build junk here? 
The scrap machines are operational! 
Such a hostile workplace! My poor fellow machines... 
Nice of them to come all this way! ...Jerks. 
Enough to make a robot puke! Er, if we could. 
Aw, thanks, Copen! 
What are those things down there? 
Adding "grinder" to dictionary... Ding! Lola gained +1 Wisdom! 
Er, try not to fall into the grinder, okay? 
A hexapyle? Blech! Let's blow it up good. 
Septima detected ahead, Copen. We're getting close. 
You know, Copen? I've been thinking... you and this chef guy aren't that different after all. 
Geez, Copen. Don't sugarcoat it or anything. Are you still sore because I said you two were alike? 
Hey, a mirror shard! Neato. 

Yikes! Burny! Hot and burny! 
They'll probably use that time to cause trouble. But I say we cause trouble for them! Eh, Copen? Eh? 
Er, you know this thing? 
Better destroy that hexapyle if we want to meet Nori. 

No hitches insofar. 
Can't tell for sure if it'll work until we meet Mytyl, though... 
I'm looking forward to it, Copen! 
Heh heh! 
The surprise is a big success! 
Well, Mytyl? Surprised? 
These warm feelings transmitted to me through the mirror shards equipped on me... 
This is...the trust of Mytyl towards Copen... 
Their...the bonds of brother and sister... 
Me and Copen... 
I want a real bond, too... 
N-nope! It's nothing! 
Mytyl... 
She's really happy... 
A brooch... 
How enviable... 
Huh? What was I thinking of...? 
N-nope! It's nothing! 
It's nothing...really... 

It's nuts seeing a ritzy hotel iced over like this. 
But no one could be ready for this! 
What's that? An icicle? 
Hey, Copen? I think I feel something here... 
He's getting away! Um, aren't you going to chase him down? 
Really? The old Copen would have chased him down for sure. 
I think he's trying to psyche you out. 
Temperature's still dropping. You okay, Copen? 
I dunno. You seem a little fazed. 
H-Hey! We're partners! 
Welp, this is gonna be fun. 
I'm feeling something... 

Are you ok, Copen?! This foe was pretty tough... 
I properly retrieved it! This is the fifth one! 
Optical camouflage! 
Copen! 
Won't let ya! 
I'll protect you, Copen! 
Aaaah! 
Copen...I'm so glad...you're..ok... 

Huh? Huh-uh? Huh...? I can't see anything...what...happened to me? 
Is this...? Copen's...voice? I see..I'm gradually remembering...I'm sure that...I was fighting an Eden Adept... 
Huh? Copen...?I'm...a failure...? 
Oh...y-yeah...I'm fine... 
Copen...You wouldn't sadden? 
Ah...n-nope! It's nothing!
W-well then! Let's hurry onto the next battle! 
Huh? 
Even if I can't use the Bits...I can properly battle! 
What can I...? W-well then...apart from battling...apart from battling...is there something I can do? 
T-that's...! That's...I'm...no longer useful...? 
Copen, you...you're an IDIOT! 

Copen...you're horrible. Despite that, I can still be useful to you... 
Woah?! Who are you?! 
A magic girl?! 
The mere ring of that name makes you VERY suspicious... 
Suspicious...could it be?! An enemy Adept?! There's often some of them...some nut who insist that the Septima is "magic"... 
Oh? 
True, I don't feel a septima, but...huh? Speaking of which...this reaction, where have I...? And...wait a minute! How do you know my name?! 
Not at all...I have no distress at all... 
Wha! That's not the case at...! 
FISHY! 
hah hah! You gotta be one of those "scammers"! 
"Makai"...? There's nothing in your words that allows me to believe you... 
Aren't you reversing magic girls and mascots?! 
They exists?! 
Woah! What the hell, don't do it by force! Huh! Hey! Stop it! Don't put it here...! STOP! 
What...happened to me? Where's this...? A park? 
Huh? "Miss"...? Do you mean me? 
"Older"...? I'm a robot, but... 
W-What "those"?! I'm a Battle Pod with an ancient and venerable origin! 
S-she left...speaking of which...I feel odd...like my body's feelings are different from the usual... 
Oh...something's fallen from the pendant. What's this? A memo paper? What, what? "Congratulations. You've become a human girl. However, if your identity is found out then you'll turn into bubbles like in the clichés and vanish, so be careful. By a kind Magic Girl"...EEEEEHHH?! S-speaking of which...I'm the one who picked up the paper with a hand?! And say...what does "Turning into bubbles and vanishing" mean?! 
Woah! Copen?! Why are you here?! 
I-I see...He can't tell that I'm Lola due to this appearance...Careless of me! If he'd found me out I'd become bubbles! 
Hum, I...no, wrong! What I said was Robin...Robin..? Robin! I thought that you looked like Robin, but it'd seem I mistook you with him! Dear me! What a blunder on my part! Sorry, sorry! 
Huh, I see...what a coincidence! 
Huh, a robot? No, haven't seen it...
S-say...Lola, is it? What's happened to her? 
The day before yesterday?! So much time has passed?! 
And Lola...? You're worried about her, no...? 
But she's a robot, no? You won't give it up and...make a new one? 
Copen...! 
Copen...! Why did you say that I'm a failure? 
So you're saying that I look raggy? 
No, no, It's fine! 
I know! I'll search for Lola with you! Lola's a girl, right? It'd be better to have my opinion as well! 
Huh?! T-that's...See! 
You said that Lola resembles me, no? If it turned out to be a boy...you'd be a really unmannered guy. 
Is something the matter? 
M-maybe...we have good compatibility? 
Oh well! Don't worry about it! Let's go! 
Huh, what do I do? Somehow, it's turned ito something amazing. Sheesh, now I'm desperate! What does Copen really think of me...? I'll seek the truth of that! 

Yup! I thought that it'd be likely for a robot to be here, but...was it too simple? 
Glad to know! Oh! Look, look, Copen! These parts! What quality! And this price! They're very cheap! It's an expendable, let's buy that at least! 
Huh? Ah-ah! Wrong! This is... 
Huh? R-really? 
Ah-Ah! Phew! Thought I'd be found out! 
True...a normal girl wouldn't be rejoicing at a parts shop...gotta be careful! 
S-so it'd seem! My intuition failed me, huh? 
'Sup? 
My name...? Ah! Ummm...Ro...Ro...Ro...RoRo! I'm named RoRo! Yes! 
Aah, guess this was too simplistic... 
Good safe! 
T-the government! What's the government doing, letting all those dangerous Adepts on the loose...right? 
So you're that type of person, Copen? 
No, it's nothing. 
That asides, let's go to the next spot! Let's see...how about a record shop? 
Oh, ooohh...Lola...she's a robot, and yet...she even listens to songs! 
Heh heh! Praise me! Praise me more! 
Huh?! W-well...w-well, don't mind it! 
That asides, let's go to the record shop! 

We beat the Adept but Mytyl was taken away... 

Copen! I can’t sit idle, either! Let’s make sure to save Mytyl! 
Don’t get carried off by your impatience. Impatience brings defeat. 
What was that? I’ve never seen aterrain like that... 
Looks like we’ll have to climb upwards. 
But, say...why did these Eden guys build this fortress in this nation...? 
I wonder...Where do these holes lead to? 
All of that aside...I hope that Mytyl is alright... 
Copen... 
What?! You didn’t mean me?! I know that Mytyl is very important but... 
Sheesh...Talk about a siscon big bro...take care of my maintenance once we rescue Mytyl and we’re back home! 

This feeling...What is it? A hum that data can’t grasp...? 
The door in front has a very strong protection, doesn’t look like it’ll open... 
I set the auxiliary camera’s control value to 3+, are you able to see a bit of what’s ahead? 
There’s a platform on the other side, do a Blitz Dash without hesitating! 
You can’t go back anyway so how about you use the Blitz Dash already? 
I searched the terrain...There’s a hole below. Drop down and do a Blitz Dash when you’re about to fall! 
This shutter doesn’t seem to open. Let’s hurry on ahead. 

What’s with this guy...? He’s so ANNOYING! 

Huh? Say...Haven’t we heard a similar story somewhere before? 
Ah! This feeling...The Mirror shards within me are reacting...Zonda and Mytyl should be very close by! 
Only thing left is beating the big boss...Zonda... 

So we’re going to make our way through on our own... 
Guess the other Psychics are waiting beyond those...
Who’s a ball?! I’m a battle pod with an ancient and venerable origin! While we’re at it: isn’t that robot a big ball to begin with! 
SHEESH! 
Copen...! 

I can feel it...Mytyl’s presence is coming from there...so the reason why the Mirror shards react close to Mytyl is... 
Yeah...That’s right... 
Copen...Is Mytyl alright...? 

Uh...What’s this...?! 
Uwaah! 

Y-yeah...The Mirror shards got stolen but I did make a backup of the data. You can use the “EX Weapons” and the systems seems to work normally. I don’t think I can transform into that Human form, though... 

Copen... 
...What’s...this...? I can’t...control...my...self... 

...Copen? 
Ah! Wait for me! Copen!
