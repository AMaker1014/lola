Well, I *am* pretty great... 
Maybe you need a nap, boss.
But if you get killed because you're tired? What then, huh? Look, I get you're worried about Mytyl. It's cute. Nice, even. But if you let it consume you, it ends up hurting everyone. Now get some damn rest so you're ready for the next mission! 
Now if only you'd be that sensible more often. 
Heh heh. 
He's lying, Mytyl. 
Aw yeah, girl! Put it on me right now! 
This is starting to get a bit weird, boss.
Oh yeah! That's the stuff! Right there! Mmmrrrgghhh... 
Mytyl! Girl! I haven't seen you in forevs! 
Ha! As if you could build someone as witty as me! 
You two are both starting to scare me. 
We're still on for today, right, girl? 
Mytyl's gonna help me create a new outfit! 
You don't understand anything, boss! Style is important no matter *what* you're doing! Right, Mytyl? 
Whoa, hold on! That's delicate machinery! 
Yeah, man! Who sits around pounding on machines? Not cool! 
I am? ...Oh! I am! The ol' red badge of courage, I guess. 
Aw, thanks girl! I don't know what to say...
