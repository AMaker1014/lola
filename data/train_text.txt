Well, I *am* pretty great... 
Maybe you need a nap, boss.
But if you get killed because you're tired? What then, huh? Look, I get you're worried about Mytyl. It's cute. Nice, even. But if you let it consume you, it ends up hurting everyone. Now get some damn rest so you're ready for the next mission! 
Now if only you'd be that sensible more often. 
Heh heh. 
He's lying, Mytyl. 
Aw yeah, girl! Put it on me right now! 
This is starting to get a bit weird, boss.
Oh yeah! That's the stuff! Right there! Mmmrrrgghhh... 
Mytyl! Girl! I haven't seen you in forevs! 
Ha! As if you could build someone as witty as me! 
You two are both starting to scare me. 
We're still on for today, right, girl? 
Mytyl's gonna help me create a new outfit! 
You don't understand anything, boss! Style is important no matter *what* you're doing! Right, Mytyl? 
Whoa, hold on! That's delicate machinery! 
Yeah, man! Who sits around pounding on machines? Not cool! 
I am? ...Oh! I am! The ol' red badge of courage, I guess. 
Aw, thanks girl! I don't know what to say... 

Her hair? Oooo, I'm sooooo scared! 
Ack! Hair! 
I take back my earlier snarky comment about the hair. 
Looks like too much pie for you, fatty! 
So why not lock onto the floating guys? If you do it right, I bet you can climb up faster. 
What, you've been here?! Man, no one tells me anything. 
I haven't seen these kinds of machines before. 
Catch the tailwind with a dash jump! 
So you've been here before, eh, boss? Must have been pretty great, yeah? I mean, space? Come on! 
Aw, don't be such a hardcase! 
You know it! Nori will totally freak if we're any later. 

Great, I think! EX Weapon system is looking fine. I should be good to go whenever. 
I guess adding power to my A.S. Drive worked, eh? But if you use an EX Weapon and consume the gauge...you'll lose the ability to use your Flashshield. Basically, exactly like how it works with Stellar Spark.
Hey, yeah! Exactly! You should put that on a T-shirt.

This place is real run down. We sure they build junk here? 
The scrap machines are operational! 
Such a hostile workplace! My poor fellow machines... 
Nice of them to come all this way! ...Jerks. 
Enough to make a robot puke! Er, if we could. 
Aw, thanks, boss! 
What are those things down there? 
Adding "grinder" to dictionary... Ding! Lola gained +1 Wisdom! 
Er, try not to fall into the grinder, okay? 
A hexapyle? Blech! Let's blow it up good. 
Septima detected ahead, boss. We're getting close. 
You know, boss? I've been thinking... you and this chef guy aren't that different after all. 
Geez, boss. Don't sugarcoat it or anything. Are you still sore because I said you two were alike? 
Hey, a mirror shard! Neato. 

Yikes! Burny! Hot and burny! 
They'll probably use that time to cause trouble. But I say we cause trouble for them! Eh, boss? Eh? 
Er, you know this thing? 
Better destroy that hexapyle if we want to meet Nori. 

No hitches insofar. 
Can't tell for sure if it'll work until we meet Mytyl, though... 
I'm looking forward to it, Copen! 
Heh heh! 
The surprise is a big success! 
Well, Mytyl? Surprised? 
These warm feelings transmitted to me through the mirror shards equipped on me... 
This is...the trust of Mytyl towards Copen... 
Their...the bonds of brother and sister... 
Me and Copen... 
I want a real bond, too... 
N-nope! It's nothing! 
Mytyl... 
She's really happy... 
A brooch... 
How enviable... 
Huh? What was I thinking of...? 
N-nope! It's nothing! 
It's nothing...really... 

It's nuts seeing a ritzy hotel iced over like this. 
But no one could be ready for this! 
What's that? An icicle? 
Hey, Copen? I think I feel something here... 
He's getting away! Um, aren't you going to chase him down? 
Really? The old Copen would have chased him down for sure. 
I think he's trying to psyche you out. 
Temperature's still dropping. You okay, boss? 
I dunno. You seem a little fazed. 
H-Hey! We're partners! 
Welp, this is gonna be fun. 
I'm feeling something... 

Are you ok, Copen?! 
This foe was pretty tough... 
I properly retrieved it! 
This is the fifth one! 
Optical camouflage! 
Copen! 
Won't let ya! 
I'll protect you, Copen! 
Aaaah! 
Copen...I'm so glad...you're..ok... 

Huh? 
Huh-uh? 
Huh...? 
I can't see anything... 
What...happened to me? 
Is this...? 
Copen's...voice? 
I see..I'm gradually remembering... 
I'm sure that... 
I was fighting an Eden Adept... 
Huh? 
Copen...? 
I'm...a failure...? 

Oh...y-yeah...I'm fine... 
Copen... 
You wouldn't sadden? 
Ah...n-nope! 
It's nothing!
W-well then! Let's hurry onto the next battle! 
Huh? 
Even if I can't use the Bits... 
I can properly battle! 
What can I...? 
W-well then...apart from battling... 
Apart from battling... 
Is there something I can do? 
T-that's...! 
That's... 
I'm...no longer useful...? 
Copen, you... 
You're an IDIOT!
